         On behalf of Sri Lankan MICE industry we would like to thank Sri Lanka Convention
         Bureau & Chairman Mr. Thisum Jayasuriya, General Manager Mr. Krishantha
         Fernando, Marketing Manager Ms. Malkanthi Welikala for the initiative taken to
         organize the Southern MICE Expo 2024 & the opportunity given to Aitken Spence
         Travels to be the Event Management Company after a competitive bidding process.



         We are confident that the investment made by SLCB for the Southern MICE Expo 2024
         will bring the expected return on investment.


         Looking forward to working with SLCB towards many more successful events.
